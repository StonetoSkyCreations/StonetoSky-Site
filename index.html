        <h2>About Brooke</h2>
        <p>Brooke is a designer, artist, and singer who moves between worlds – digital and hand-drawn, inner and outer, personal and collective.</p>
        <p>Her work weaves three main strands:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Branding &amp; design for soul-led projects and small businesses</li>
          <li>Artwork &amp; illustration that honour the seasons, the body, and the Earth</li>
          <li>Singing &amp; facilitation in circles, ceremonies, and community spaces</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Stone to Sky is the meeting point of these threads: a place for clear, grounded design that still remembers we belong to something sacred and alive.</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <p style="color:var(--muted); font-size:0.9rem;">
          “There is a creative flame that has burned and flourished throughout my life. It’s taken many forms and continues to evolve as I do. My work is a devoted prayer to the Earth, to beauty, and to the cycles that hold us.”
        </p>

  <section id="singing">
    <div class="container">
      <h2>Singing &amp; Facilitation</h2>
      <p>My voice work lives in circles, ceremonies, and small gatherings where people come to soften, listen, and reconnect.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Singing and sound in ceremony and ritual spaces</li>
        <li>Co-facilitation of retreats and workshops</li>

  <section id="cocreate">
    <div class="container">
      <h2>Co-Creative Projects</h2>
      <p>Some of the most alive work happens in the overlap – where design, art, and song come together around a shared intention.</p>
      <p>I’m open to collaboration on:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Visual worlds and storytelling for creative projects</li>
        <li>Offerings that blend artwork, song, and ritual</li>
        <li>Seasonal and Earth-based projects that need both design and facilitation</li>
        <li>Quiet, long-term creative partnerships with aligned people and places</li>
